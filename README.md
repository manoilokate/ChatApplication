# ChatApplication
## About the project
This project demonstrates how real-time chat works by using Azure SignalR.
You can chatting with everyone who connected the site in real time, and unlimited number of users in the chat. As a database for storing chat history, I used Azure SQL Db.
Also, for an easier understanding of how it works, I left comments directly in the project itself )

This site was built and [deploy](https://app-chat-web-northeurope-dev-001.azurewebsites.net) using Azure.
Update: I have exhausted my credit limit, so the project is not active. (03/01/2025)
